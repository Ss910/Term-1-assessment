# for loop: when you know beforehand how many times to iterate over a sequence (predetermined no)
# while loop: when you want to iterate over a sequence as long as a condition holds true (can be any no of times)

# examle of for loop

while int(num) <= 0: # no of times iterated depends on user input
  num = input("not positive non zero number, try again: ")
